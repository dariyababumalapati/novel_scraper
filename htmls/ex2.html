step 1: extract all the html
	* since it's in the developing stage write a function to extract all the
	html of a page (mainly for testing)
	* write another function to get the main tag containing the all the novel
	chapter text <div class="entry-content">.

step 2: refine the html and get the only desired parts
	* get the h1 tag and store it in a variable
		~ problem with the h1 tag some novels pages doesn't have the h1 tag so
		I'm thinking of creating the h1 tag and enter the text manually.
		~ Get the Id column from the database and enter along with

	* get all the p tags and get only the novel_p_tags

step 3: Create the useful html
	* create an empty main tag
	* add the h1 tag and the novel_p_tags to the empty tag

step 4: Retrieve the urls list from the database.
	* Access the chapter title and the url from the retrieved records.

step 5: Store the new formed main tag in the database:
